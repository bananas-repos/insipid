To get more information if your are stuck:

Edit index.php (or email-import.php if you have trouble with it) and change the following setting:

FROM: define('DEBUG',false);
TO: define('DEBUG',true);

Alter it to false after your are done. Do not use this permanently since it displays unwanted and even
sensitive information to everyone.
