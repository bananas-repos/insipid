Insipid has a feature to fetch new links from e-mails.
Those e-mails are read from a configured IMAP mailbox.

You need to enable the imap functions within PHP and
have a IMAP mailbox on a SSL/TLS email server.

Set the config variables in the config file.
Make sure you an individual marker string!
There is no "security" within this method. Only the special string you can define.
The new links will be hidden at first. You need to verify them before they are
visible in your list.

Here are the important configs:

EMAIL_SERVER => Address of your E-Mail server
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT_IMAP => The SSL Imap port. Default: 993
EMAIL_SERVER_MAILBOX => The name of your Inbox. Default: INBOX

EMAIL_REPORT_BACK => set this to true if you want to report to the sender. Default: false
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT_SMTP => The SSL SMTP port for using the report back function. Default: 465
EMAIL_REPLY_BACK_VALID => Multiple E-Mails addresses which can be reported back to.
EMAIL_REPLY_BACK_ADDRESS => The E-Mail address which sends the report mail. Usually the address from which your read the mails


Syntax of the email body:

absolute-link|multiple,category,strings|multiple,tag,strings\n
new-absolute-link|multiple,category,strings|multiple,tag,strings\n
