Insipid has a feature to fetch new links from e-mails. 
Those e-mails are read from a configured IMAP mailbox.

You need to enable the imap functions within PHP and
have a IMAP mailbox on a SSL/TLS email server.

Set the config variables in the config file.
Make sure you an individual marker string!
There is no "security" within this method. Only the special string you can define.
The new links will be hidden at first. You need to verify them before they are 
visible in your list.

Syntax of the email body:

absolute-link|multiple,category,strings|multiple,tag,strings\n
new-absolute-link|multiple,category,strings|multiple,tag,strings\n
