Any link can be exported as a xml file from the link info view.
Login is required to trigger this function.
The result can be used to import it again at the stats view.

It exports all the link information, image and its tags and categories.

The import can overwrite existing links and import non existing ones.

A import xml file can contain multiple exports. Make sure the root is
still there.
