# Requirements
wkhtmlimage from https://wkhtmltopdf.org (tested with wkhtmltoimage 0.12.5)

# Setup
Change WKHTMLTOPDF_USE to true and alter the path WKHTMLTOPDF_COMMAND to your wkhtmltoimage install

# Why wkhtmltoimage and not something newer or better?
puppeteer is kinda overkill and the whole npm is, well, moren then that...

chromdriver and chrome was also some overkill and there was no simple
php implementation.
