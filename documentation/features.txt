Insipid is a web-based bookmark manager similar to the Delicious service.

It lets you manage and host your own bookmarks. No talking to other servervices or agencies.
Your data is your data.

Bookmarks are put into categories and should have tags.

New links will be checked and tried to get as much as possible information automatically.

If you enable the email importer, emails contents will be automatically added to the database.
