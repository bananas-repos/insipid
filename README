Insipid is a web-based bookmark manager similar to the Delicious service.

Rename the insipid-config.cgi.example to insipid-config.cgi and edit it,
replacing the example values with those that match your system.  Make sure 
that the line "dbtype" is set:

# For MySQL:
dbtype = mysql

# For PostgreSQL:
dbtype = Pg

Create a user and password for the database if you don't have one assigned
to you by your adiministrator or ISP.  Doing this is beyond the scope of this
readme file - refer to the MySQL or PostgreSQL server documentation for more
help.

Rename the htaccess file to .htaccess and add a "RewriteBase" clause to the 
top, such as:

    RewriteBase /~luke/

You can optionally add "insipid.cgi" to the list of files in the 
DirectoryIndex line (for example, "DirectoryIndex index.cgi insipid.cgi").

The non-standard Perl packages required for use (with their Debian package
names) are:

    Module           Debian Package
    --------------   ------------------------------------
    Date::Format     libtimedate-perl
    XML::Parser      libxml-parser-perl
    XML::Writer      libxml-writer-perl

Once the configuration is finished, access the insipid.cgi through your
web browser at the URL you've configured and the database should be 
automatically configured.

If you ever upgrade Insipid, the database schema will be automatically 
updated upon access.
